Changes
=======

1.0.0-alpha3 to 1.0.0-alpha4
----------------------------
* [UI] Bugfix: Fixed adding samples to the cart from associated projects.
* [UI] Bugfix: File downloads should now start instantly instead of after a long delay; Upgraded Dandelion library to work resolve issues with downloading files.
* [Workflow] Bugfix: Pipelines are now executed in the background with the user account that submitted them rather than a system user. This change was made to facilitate running pipelines with federated data sources.
* [UI] Bugfix: Samples from remote associated projects are displayed even if the project has no local associated projects.
* [UI] Bugfix: Fixed showing a "Page not found" page was shown after editing sample details. (Thanks to Matt Walker for finding this one)

* [Developer] removed several unused and unnecessary css files.
* [Developer] conditionally hide certain fields and buttons if an e-mail server is not configured.
* [Developer] Bugfix: fixed a long-standing bug where expressions for showing Thymeleaf properties would sometimes randomly break page rendering by 1) updating the Thymeleaf library to actually show the errors instead of silently ignoring them, and 2) disabling expression caching in Thymeleaf (due to a bug in Spring, bug reported upstream at: https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-13247).
