* [Tools] Bugfix: Resolved issue where multiple multiple OAuth token requests by the same client using the same user credentials was resulting in duplicated OAuth access tokens being issued. (Issue #324)
* [Tools] Papercut: Remove sequencer ID column from back-end, only use the sample name field from sample sheets to reduce confusion about how data is uploaded to samples.
* [Developer] Removed all unused code for transferring files to arbitrary instances of Galaxy, feature is supported by IRIDA Import tool in NML Galaxy.

1.0.0-alpha3 to 1.0.0-alpha4
----------------------------
* [UI] Bugfix: Fixed adding samples to the cart from associated projects.
* [UI] Bugfix: File downloads should now start instantly instead of after a long delay; Upgraded Dandelion library to work resolve issues with downloading files.

* [Developer] conditionally hide certain fields and buttons if an e-mail server is not configured.
* [Developer] Bugfix: fixed a long-standing bug where expressions for showing Thymeleaf properties would sometimes randomly break page rendering by 1) updating the Thymeleaf library to actually show the errors instead of silently ignoring them, and 2) disabling expression caching in Thymeleaf (due to a bug in Spring, bug reported upstream at: https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-13247).
