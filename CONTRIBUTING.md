### Reporting a bug

Reporting a bug is the easiest (and possibly most useful) way you can contribute to IRIDA.  IRIDA uses GitHub to track our issues.

Note: IRIDA's GitHub issue board is for bug reports or feature requests only.  You should not use it for usage issues, problems with analyzing your data, or problems setting up IRIDA.  For issues of this nature, please contact the IRIDA team by one of the other means described at the top of this document.

If you find an issue while using IRIDA that you feel is a problem with the software, first check out our [GitHub issues board](https://github.com/phac-nml/irida/issues) to see if someone has already reported the issue.  If you find a similar issue, we would still like to hear about your specific issue.  Add a comment to the issue stating how the issue occurred.

If you do not find a similar issue, please create a new issue with (at least) the following information:

1. Where were you using IRIDA? (public IRIDA, private install, virtual machine, etc)
2. What were you doing when the issue happened?
3. What did you expect to happen?
4. What actually happened?

When you're done, please label the new issue as a `bug` and we will triage it as soon as we can.

### Submitting a feature

Before writing a bunch of code for a new feature, we would love to discuss the feature you're trying to build!  We may have a similar feature in the works where you can help contribute.
