Installing Galaxy Tools
-----------------------

This directory includes files to quickly install all necessary tools within an existing Galaxy instance for IRIDA.  Please see <https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/administrator/galaxy/> for details on how to set up an IRIDA Galaxy instance.  In particular, if this is a new Galaxy installation, the [IRIDA Toolshed](https://irida.corefacility.ca/galaxy-shed/) will need to be added to Galaxy along with some specific Galaxy configuration settings.

### Automated Process/Upgrading

To install any required Galaxy tools for this IRIDA version please run the following:

```bash
# Installs dependency modules for script
pip install -r install-tools-requirements.txt

# Do installation of Galaxy tools
python install_tool_shed_tools.py --toolsfile tools-list.yml --galaxy [http://url-to-galaxy] --apikey [api key]
```
Where `[http://url-to-galaxy]` is the URL to your Galaxy instance for IRIDA and `[api key]` is the API key for your IRIDA Galaxy instance.

### Manual Process

If the automated installation process does not work, or to test out the tools, please see the online documentation at <https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/administrator/galaxy/>.
