Installation
============

Installing Galaxy Tools
-----------------------

This directory includes files to quickly install all necessary tools within an existing Galaxy instance for IRIDA.  Please see <https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/administrator/galaxy/> for details on how to set up an IRIDA Galaxy instance.  In particular, if this is a new Galaxy installation, the [IRIDA Toolshed](https://irida.corefacility.ca/galaxy-shed/) will need to be added to the Galaxy `config/tool_sheds_conf.xml` file along with some specific Galaxy configuration settings, listed at <https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/administrator/galaxy/#step-3-modify-configuration-file>.

Some additional dependencies will need to be installed outside of Galaxy in order to get all tools to build.  These include:

* [Perl 5](https://www.perl.org/)
* Perl modules - `Readonly Time::Piece XML::Simple Data::Dumper Bio::Perl`
* [Java](https://java.com/) 1.6+
* [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/)

More information can be found at <https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/administrator/galaxy/#galaxy-tools-installation>.

### Automated Process/Upgrading

To install any required Galaxy tools for this IRIDA version please run the following:

```bash
# Installs dependency modules for script
pip install -r install-tools-requirements.txt

# Do installation of Galaxy tools
python install_tool_shed_tools.py --toolsfile tools-list.yml --galaxy [http://url-to-galaxy] --apikey [api key]
```
Where `[http://url-to-galaxy]` is the URL to your Galaxy instance for IRIDA and `[api key]` is the API key for your IRIDA Galaxy instance.

Following installation/upgrade of tools, some small updates to software may need to be applied.  In particular the software `tbl2asn`, used by Prokka, needs to be kept up to date with the latest copy at least once per year.  If `tbl2asn` is not kept up to date, eventually a Prokka run will report an error message when running tbl2asn that it has expired.

The most recently updated version is available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tbl2asn2/>.  To update, please log into the Galaxy server and run:

```bash
find tool_dependencies/ -wholename '*tbl2asn'
```

Where **tool_dependencies/** is the Galaxy directory storing tool dependencies.  This will list all the `tbl2asn` binaries currently installed.  To enable these to run they must be updated to the latest version from NCBI.  More information can be found at <https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/administrator/galaxy/pipelines/assembly-annotation/#step-2-install-galaxy-tools>.

### Manual Process

If the automated installation process does not work, or to test out the tools, please see the online documentation at <https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/administrator/galaxy/>.

Installing IRIDA
----------------

### New Installation

For details on installation of IRIDA from scratch, please refer to the online documentation at <https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/>.

### Upgrading IRIDA

Please refer to the `UPGRADING.md` file for details on upgrading between IRIDA versions as well as the online documentation at <https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/>.  For the most part, upgrading will involve copying over and re-deploying the `*.war` file included in this distribution.
