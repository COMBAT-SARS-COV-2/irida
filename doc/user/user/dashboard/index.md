For more information about running pipelines, please see the [launching pipelines](../pipelines) section.

### Analyses

After you've launched a pipeline, you can monitor its progress and view results by clicking on the "Analyses" button.

Remote APIs
-----------
Remote IRIDA installations can be used as data sources for associated projects and worklows.  The "Remote APIs" section allows users to connect to remote IRIDA installations.  

**Note**: You must have been provided with a username and password for a remote instance of IRIDA before you can use the data located on that instance.

![Remote API button](images/remote-api-dash.png)

Adminstrators can add or remove available Remote APIs from this menu.  Details can be found in the [administrator guide](../../administrator/#managing-remote-apis).

### Connecting to Remote APIs

The Remote APIs list will show you all configured Remote APIs.  To connect, click the "Connect" button next to an API.

If you have never connected to the remote API before, or your login has expired, you will be shown a login window for the remote site.  Enter your login credentials for that site.  The username and password that you use to connect to a remote instance of IRIDA are different than the username and password that you used to log in to the local site.
