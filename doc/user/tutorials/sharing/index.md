Sharing data in IRIDA
=====================
{:.no_toc}

Once you've got data into IRIDA, either by [web upload][web-upload] or from a sequencing facility with the [uploader tool][uploader-tool], you're probably going to want to share that data with collaborators.

In order to share data from a project, you **must** have the **Manager** role on the project. The **Manager** role implies ownership of the data contained in the project. You can find out if you have the **Manager** role by looking at the [project members section][project-members].

If the person you want to share with within IRIDA does not have a user account, you must also have permission to create a user account for that user. If you do not, then you'll need to contact someone who has permissions to create user accounts.

If the person you would like to share data with within IRIDA does not have a user account, you'll need to make an account for them.
