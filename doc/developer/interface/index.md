## JavaScript

### Webpack and Babel

IRIDA uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) with a [babel-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/babel-loader/#root) to transpile the latest versions of JavaScript to a version supported by browsers.

Current babel plugins:
- [Class Properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties)
- [Export default from](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-export-default-from) 
- [Optional Chaining](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining)
- []

### React JS

The IRIDA user interface is developed using the [React JS Framework](https://reactjs.org/), although there are legacy pages that still contain jQuery and AngularJS. **All new development for IRIDA is expected to be done in React**.



## Ant Design

IRIDA uses the design system [Ant Design](https://ant.design/), a [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) based component library.
