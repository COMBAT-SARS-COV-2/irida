        Whole-genome sequencing has proven itself to be an effective epidemiological tool (2008 Listeriosis outbreak, 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, 2010 Haiti Cholera outbreak). Unfortunately, the utility of genomic epidemiology to researchers and public health workers is inhibited by the ad-hoc nature and complexity of the bioinformatics software used in genomic epidemiology studies. The primary goal for the IRIDA FWS/GC Bioinformatics Platform is to design and implement a software platform to make genomic epidemiology a realistic and usable tool for public health workers, including epidemiologists, clinical microbiologists and researchers.
