Galaxy Setup
============
{:.no_toc}

This document describes the necessary steps for the integration of [Galaxy][] with IRIDA as well as using Galaxy and [Galaxy ToolSheds][] to install workflows.  This is broken up into two sections:

1. [Integration with existing Galaxy][integration-galaxy]: If you already have a Galaxy instance installed, this will describe the necessary changes to the configuration needed in order for IRIDA to communicate with Galaxy and exsiting workflows.
2. [Setup of a new Galaxy instance][setup-new-galaxy]: If you do not have a Galaxy instance installed, this will walk through the general procedure of setting up a new Galaxy instance.

If you encounter errors while installing Galaxy you may want to look over the [IRIDA/Galaxy FAQ][].
