Contact Information
===================

We'd like to think that our documentation is perfect, but we know that installing and running IRIDA can sometimes be not straightforward.

You may also find a bug that you want to report or may want to suggest an improvement to the development team.

You can get in touch with the IRIDA team in several different ways.

Chat
----

The best method for getting in touch with the IRIDA development team is on our IRC channel. You can find us at `#irida` on `irc.freenode.net`.

You can either use your favourite IRC client, or use the Freenode web chat interface below.
