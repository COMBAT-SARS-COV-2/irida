When you add a client, you'll be required to provide the following information:

1. A unique client ID,
2. How long a token should be valid for once issued,
3. The type of OAuth2 flow that a client should use,
4. The scopes that the client is allowed to use (should the client be allowed to read, write, or both with the REST API).
