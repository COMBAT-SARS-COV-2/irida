You can create a new project by clicking on the "Projects" menu at the top of the dashboard and selecting "Create New Project":

When you create a new project, you'll need to provide a project name, and can optionally provide a project organism, a free-form project description, and a link to another web site that has more inforamtion about the project:

![Create new project form.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/projects/create-new-project-form.png)

A project name must be **at least** 5 characters long, and **must not** contain any of the following characters: `? ( ) [ ] / \ = + < > : ; " , * ^ | &`

If you choose to set a project organism, click on the "Select an Organism" drop-down menu and begin typing the name of the organism. For example, if you wanted to specify a project organism of "Salmonella enterica", you would begin to type "Sal" and the menu would allow you to choose from a set of well-defined organism names:

![Project organism entry.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/projects/project-organism.png)

The organism names are derived from the [NCBI taxonomy database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy).

When you've finished entering the details for your new project, click on the "Create Project" button. You will be redirected to the projects list.

IRIDA will automatically generate a numeric project identifier for your project. The project identifier is used by external tools for uploading sequencing data to IRIDA. The project identifier can be found in the ["Project Details" panel]({{ site.baseurl }}/user/user/project/index.html#viewing-project-details), or in the [projects list]({{ site.baseurl }}/user/user/project/index.html#viewing-existing-projects).
