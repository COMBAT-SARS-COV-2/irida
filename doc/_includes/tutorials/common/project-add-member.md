To add a project member, click on the "Add Member" button, just below the project title:

![Add project member button.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/projects/add-member-button.png)

You can use the dialog that appears to select a user account (you can choose from a list, or click the "Select a User" field and start typing), and choose the **Project Role** that the new member should have:

**Remember**: a project collaborator has *read-only* permissions, and a project *manager* is allowed to modify project details.

Once you've selected the user and role to add the new member, click on the "Submit" button.
