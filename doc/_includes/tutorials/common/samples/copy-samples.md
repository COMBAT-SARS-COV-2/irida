Samples may be copied between projects. A sample that is copied into multiple projects is effectively *linked* between those projects -- the files contained within the sample are not physically duplicated, and any sample metadata changes in one project are reproduced in the sample in the copied project.

You must be a project <img src="images/manager-icon.png" class="inline" alt="Manager role icon."> **Manager** on **both** the project that you are copying the sample *from*, and the project that you are copying the sample *to*.

Start by [selecting the samples]({{ site.baseurl }}/user/user/samples/#selecting-samples) that you want to copy to the other project. When you've selected the samples that you want to copy, click on the "Samples" button just above the samples list, and select "Copy Samples":

![Copy samples button.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/samples/copy-samples-button.png)

In the dialog that appears you will be presented with a list of the samples that are going to be copied, and an option to choose the project that the samples should be copied to:

![Copy samples dialog.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/samples/copy-samples-dialog.png)

When you click on the drop-down box to select a project, you can either visually find the project that you want, or you can filter the projects by their name by typing into the text field.

Once you've selected the project that you want to copy the samples to, click on the "Copy Samples" button.
