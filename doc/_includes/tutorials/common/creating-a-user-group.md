Fill in the group details fields. Only the group name is required, but you can optionally provide a more detailed description of what the user group is:

![User group details form.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/users/user-group-details-form.png)

On successfully creating a new user group, you will see the user group details that you entered:

![User group details page.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/users/user-group-details-page.png)

By default, your user account is assigned to the group as the group owner. You can add other users to the group by clicking on the "Add Group Member" button:

In the dialog that appears, choose the user that you want to add and the group role that the user should have. Group owners are allowed to add new members to the group. Group members are not allowed to add new members to the group.
